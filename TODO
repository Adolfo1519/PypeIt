The following is a list of items that are currently in development

** All items in the code with msgs.work("message") need to be implemented

* Write sorted files to ascii and fits table (let the user pick which method)
* Store master calibrations for each master frame (to save recalculating the solutions -- including slit trace, tilts, and wavelength)
* Flexure correction (TH)
* Extraction (RJC)
* Force matplotlib RC params of plots to be the default throughout (i.e. don't allow user-specified matplotlib rcparams)
* Save all QA to a single fits file and/or pdf file (?).
