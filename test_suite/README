Data for Test Suite runs for PYPIT

You should have your own directory outside
of the Dropbox for running the test suites.
And you need to setup an environemental variable
pointing to it, e.g.

setenv TST_PYPIT /Users/xavier/PYPIT/TEST_SUITES/

You also need an environmental variable pointing to the
PYPIT code:

setenv PYPIT /Users/xavier/local/Python/PYPIT/

Then let it rip.

./run_pypit_tests
