Data for Test Suite runs for PYPIT

You should have your own directory outside
of the Dropbox for running the test suites.
And you need to setup an environemental variable
pointing to it, e.g.

setenv TST_PYPIT /Users/xavier/PYPIT/TEST_SUITES/

You also need an environmental variable pointing to the PYPIT code:

setenv PYPIT /Users/xavier/local/Python/PYPIT/

You may also need an environmental variable pointing to the PYPIT CALIBS:

setenv PYPIT_CALIBS /Users/xavier/Dropbox//PYPIT/CALIBS

Then let it rip.

./run_pypit_tests.py
