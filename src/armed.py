    Automatic Reduction and Modeling of Echelle Data

    Parameters
    ----------
    argflag : dict
      Arguments and flags used for reduction
    spect : dict
      Properties of the spectrograph.
    fitsdict : dict
      Contains relevant information from fits header files
    msgs : class
      Messages class used to log data reduction process
    reuseMaster : bool
      If True, a master frame that will be used for another science frame
      will not be regenerated after it is first made.
      This setting comes with a price, and if a large number of science frames are
      being generated, it may be more efficient to simply regenerate the master
      calibrations on the fly.

    Returns
    -------
    status : int
      Status of the reduction procedure
      0 = Successful execution
