The following are a few instrument-specific tutorials.  If this is your first
time using PypeIt, you're encouraged to read through the Shane Kast tutorial as
a general example of how to use PypeIt; see also the :ref:`cookbook`.

The Shane Kast tutorial can also be used as an example of how to reduce
**long-slit** data with PypeIt.  See the Keck DEIMOS tutorial as a general
introduction to **multi-slit** reductions with PypeIt, and see the Gemini-GNIRS
tutorial for an example of reduction **NIR data** with PypeIt.
