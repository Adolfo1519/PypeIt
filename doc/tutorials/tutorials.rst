The following are a few instrument-specific tutorials.  If this is your first
time using PypeIt, you're encouraged to read through the Shane Kast tutorial as
a general example of how to use PypeIt; see also the :ref:`cookbook`.

The Shane Kast tutorial can also be used as an example of how to reduce
**long-slit** data with PypeIt.  See the Keck DEIMOS tutorial as a general
introduction to **multi-slit** reductions with PypeIt.  The Gemini-GNIRS
tutorial serves as an example of both an **echelle** reduction and a **NIR**
reduction with PypeIt.

For additional instrument-specific recommendations, please see the links at
the bottom of the :doc:`../spectrographs/spectrographs` page.
