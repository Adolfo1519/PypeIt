The following are a few instrument-specific tutorials.

If this is your **first time using PypeIt**, you're encouraged to read through
the Shane Kast tutorial as a general example of how to use PypeIt; see also the
:ref:`cookbook`.  **You are encouraged to pull example data from the DevSuite
for your instrument when learning how to use the software;** see :ref:`dev-suite`.

For different types of data (long-slit, echelle, etc), we recommend the
following starting points:

    - **Long-slit data**: :doc:`Shane Kast<kast_howto>`

    - **Multi-slit data**: :doc:`Keck DEIMOS<deimos_howto>`

    - **NIR data**: :doc:`Gemini GNIRS<gnirs_howto>`

    - **Echelle data**: :doc:`Gemini GNIRS<gnirs_howto>`

For additional instrument-specific recommendations, please see the links at the
bottom of the :doc:`../spectrographs/spectrographs` page.  The full set of
available tutorials are as follows.
