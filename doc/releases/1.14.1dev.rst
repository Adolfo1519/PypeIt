Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug associated with finding more than one file with the same name (but
  presumably different extensions).
- Fixed differential atmospheric refraction (DAR) correction bug. This bug affected
  datacubes combined using CoAdd3D(). Previously, the DAR was being computed, applied,
  and then later overwritten. The new routine is faster and more accurate.
