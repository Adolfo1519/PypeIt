Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Allow the selection of a secondary filter option  for all spectrographs
that need it; see new ``filter2`` parameter.
=======
- When dealing with `bkg_redux` reduction (i.e., A-B), a sky model (called `bkg_redux_skymodel`)
  is generated using the A frame, while the existing `skymodel` is generated using the A-B frame.
  This allows to have an actual 1D extracted sky spectrum and to perform the flexure correction for
  `bkg_redux` reduction.
- Various improvements in the flexure correction and added the possibility to use a modeled archive
  sky spectrum generated with `pypeit.wavemodel.nearIR_modelsky()` to perform the flexure correction.

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------
- Improvements for SOAR/Goodman
    - Added ``WAVMODE`` header keyword to ``configuration keys`` and
     ``raw header cards``.

- Added example of improved wavelength solution for GEMINI/GMOS

Script Changes
--------------

Datamodel Changes
-----------------
- `Spec2DObj` now has an additional image, called `bkg_redux_skymodel`, which is the "actual" sky model
  in the case of `bkg_redux` reduction (i.e., dithered observations). This image is not generated if
  `bkg_redux` is False. In any case, the `skymodel` is always generated.

Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------

Bug Fixes
---------

- The subpixel algorithm used to resample datacubes that are generated by `pypeit_coadd_datacube`
  produced error cubes that were not properly propagating the noise. The error cubes of the NGP
  algorithm were unaffected. The error cubes are now regularly inspected with vet tests to ensure
  the error cubes are reliable.
