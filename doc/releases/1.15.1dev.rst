Version 1.15.1dev
=================

Installation Changes
--------------------

Dependency Changes
------------------

Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------

- Added example of improved wavelength solution for GEMINI/GMOS

Script Changes
--------------

- A new script, called `pypeit_extract_datacube`, allows 1D spectra of point
  sources to be extracted from datacubes.
- The sensitivity function is now generated outside of datacube generation.
- The `grating_corr` column is now used to select the correct grating
  correction file for each spec2d file when generating the datacube.

Datamodel Changes
-----------------

Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------

Bug Fixes
---------

- The subpixel algorithm used to resample datacubes that are generated by `pypeit_coadd_datacube`
  produced error cubes that were not properly propagating the noise. The error cubes of the NGP
  algorithm were unaffected. The error cubes are now regularly inspected with vet tests to ensure
  the error cubes are reliable.
