Standard Stars

PypeIt has a set of standard stars used for flux
calibration that are mainly taken from the now
defunct STScI ``calspec`` package.

calspec standards
=================

The following table is an semi-complete list of the standard stars we are using from
the STScI `CALSPEC calibration database
<https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/reference-data-for-calibration-and-tools/astronomical-catalogs/calspec>`__

The standard stars below are selected from the CALSPEC database to be
observational spectra (not models) and with V<15 mag.
The full list of CALSPEC standards is available in ``pypeit/data/standards/calspec/README``.

ESO standards
=============

We now include a few ESO standard star files.

.. TODO: Include the listing here?
