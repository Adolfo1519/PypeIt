Overview

This file summarizes several instrument specific settings that are related to the Keck/HIRES spectrograph.


Wavelengths
===========

See :ref:`wvcalib-echelle` for details on the wavelength calibration.

We also note that Order 45 is frequently flagged
as bad in the wavelength solution.  This is due to, in part,
to very bright ThAr line contamination.
